# student_participation
collect info on students concerning their participation during digital learning days

This project will need to be overhauled in the following ways if it is found functional
  1. order data_input by class and student
  2. color alternating rows for easier reading
  3. section off class blocks for easier reading
  4. normalize the databse (allthough now I think it is fairly funcitonal)
  5. create admin query functionality to analyze student data
  6. list kids with no responses on front page
  7. create html of overall student data
